# ðŸš€ Unified Editing Demo - Quick Start Guide

## Access the Demo
Navigate to `/demo` route in your Genshi Studio application

## What Makes It Revolutionary?

### All 4 Modes Active Simultaneously
- **Draw** - Create strokes that become patterns
- **Parametric** - Adjust mathematical parameters  
- **Code** - Generate and execute pattern code
- **Growth** - Animate organic algorithms

### No Mode Switching Required!
All capabilities are available at once. The system intelligently translates between them in real-time.

## How to Use

### Quick Mode Focus
Press number keys to focus on a mode:
- `1` - Draw mode
- `2` - Parametric mode
- `3` - Code mode
- `4` - Growth mode

### Interactions by Mode

**Draw Mode** (Blue)
- Click and drag to create strokes
- Draw a grid pattern - watch it become parametric!

**Parametric Mode** (Purple)
- Click anywhere to adjust pattern parameters
- Position affects spacing and rotation

**Code Mode** (Green)
- Click to generate code at that position
- See live code preview popups

**Growth Mode** (Orange)
- Click to add growth seeds
- Watch organic patterns evolve

### Demo Scenarios

Click the **"Pattern Creation Flow"** button to see:
1. Drawing strokes become a grid
2. Parametric controls auto-generate
3. Code is created automatically
4. Growth algorithm animates

Click **"Bidirectional Editing"** to see:
- Changes in ANY mode update ALL modes
- True unified editing in action!

### Special Features

- **Demo Mode** - Press `Cmd/Ctrl + D` for enhanced visual feedback
- **Clear All** - Reset the canvas
- **Performance Metrics** - See real-time FPS and sync latency

## The Magic

Watch as:
- Your drawings become mathematical patterns
- Parameters generate executable code
- Code influences growth algorithms
- Growth affects your drawings

All in real-time, with <100ms synchronization!

## Try This!

1. Start in Draw mode (press `1`)
2. Draw 4-5 horizontal and vertical lines to make a grid
3. Watch as the system recognizes the pattern
4. Switch to Parametric mode (press `2`) 
5. Click and drag to adjust the grid spacing
6. Switch to Growth mode (press `4`)
7. Click in the center - watch it grow!

Experience the future of creative tools - where all modes work as one! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
