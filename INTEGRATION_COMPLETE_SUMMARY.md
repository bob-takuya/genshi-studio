  - Layer preservation in exports

#### 4. Enhanced Growth Studio (from ARCHITECT_001 design)
**Status**: ✅ Partially Enhanced
- **Components**:
  - Enhanced `InteractiveGrowthStudio` with new algorithms
  - Additional growth algorithms (L-System, Cellular Automata, etc.)
  - Multi-layer support framework
- **Location**: `/src/components/studio/InteractiveGrowthStudio.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - 10 different growth algorithms
  - L-System plant generation
  - Reaction-diffusion patterns
  - Cellular automata variants

### Navigation and UI Updates

#### 1. App Routing
**Status**: ✅ Updated
- Added route for PressureTestPage at `/pressure-test`
- All canvas modes accessible through StudioPage routing

#### 2. Main Navigation
**Status**: ✅ Updated
- Added "Pressure Test" link to header navigation
- Maintains existing navigation structure

#### 3. Toolbar Integration
**Status**: ✅ Complete
- Canvas mode switcher with buttons for:
  - Draw mode (traditional drawing)
  - Parametric mode (pattern editor)
  - Code mode (live coding with preview)
  - Growth mode (interactive growth studio)
- All modes properly connected to their respective components

### Build and Compilation
**Status**: ✅ Success
- TypeScript compilation successful
- No type errors
- Build output optimized (with expected large chunks for Monaco editor)

### Key Features Working Together

1. **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: Users can create in any mode and export to any format
2. **Unified Export Dialog**: Single interface for all export options including new vector formats
3. **Consistent UI/UX**: All modes follow the same design language and interaction patterns
4. **Shared State Management**: Zustand store manages state across all modes
5. **Responsive Design**: All features work on desktop and mobile devices

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Pressure Sensitivity**: Test with various tablets at `/pressure-test`
2. **Code Execution**: Try the examples in Code mode
3. **Vector Export**: Create complex patterns and export to SVG/PDF
4. **Growth Studio**: Experiment with different algorithms and parameters
5. **Cross-Feature**: Create in one mode, export from another

### Known Limitations

1. **Growth Studio Enhancements**: Only core algorithm enhancements integrated; full UI enhancements pending
2. **Performance**: Large canvas operations may slow on lower-end devices
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Some pressure features require modern browsers

### Next Steps

1. Complete full Growth Studio UI enhancements
2. Add more code examples and templates
3. Implement collaborative features
4. Optimize performance for large canvases
5. Add comprehensive test suite

### Summary

All major components from DEVELOPER_002, DEVELOPER_003, and DEVELOPER_004 have been successfully integrated into the main Genshi Studio application. The application now features:

- Live code execution with graphics preview
- Professional pressure-sensitive drawing
- High-quality vector export capabilities
- Enhanced growth algorithms
- Unified UI with mode switching

The integration maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful new features for digital artists and creative coders.
