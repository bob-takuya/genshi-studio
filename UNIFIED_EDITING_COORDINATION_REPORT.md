## UNIFIED EDITING SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Core Components Required

#### 1. Unified Data Model (ARCHITECT_002 Responsibility)
```typescript
interface UnifiedArtwork {
  id: string;
  layers: UnifiedLayer[];
  metadata: ArtworkMetadata;
  synchronizationState: SyncState;
}

interface UnifiedLayer {
  id: string;
  type: 'vector' | 'raster' | 'parametric' | 'code' | 'growth';
  data: LayerData;
  transformations: Transform[];
  blendMode: BlendMode;
  opacity: number;
  modeSpecificData: ModeData;
}
```

#### 2. Real-Time Synchronization Engine (DEVELOPER_006 Responsibility)
- **Operational Transform (OT) System**: Handle concurrent edits from multiple modes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent merge strategies for competing modifications
- **State Broadcasting**: WebSocket-based real-time state synchronization
- **Performance Target**: <100ms latency for all mode interactions

#### 3. Mode Translation System (DEVELOPER_007 Responsibility)
- **Vector↔Parametric**: Convert brush strokes to parametric equations
- **Code↔Visual**: Real-time code generation from visual edits
- **Growth↔Static**: Transform organic patterns to static geometry
- **Bidirectional Mapping**: Ensure edits in any mode reflect across all modes

#### 4. Unified Canvas System (DEVELOPER_008 Responsibility)
- **Multi-Mode Renderer**: Single canvas supporting all four rendering pipelines
- **Layer Compositing**: Hardware-accelerated layer blending
- **Viewport Synchronization**: Consistent view state across all modes
- **Performance Target**: 60fps with all modes active simultaneously

#### 5. User Experience Integration (UX_DESIGNER_001 Responsibility)
- **Mode Switching UI**: Seamless transitions between editing modes
- **Conflict Indication**: Visual feedback for edit conflicts
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for partial feature support
