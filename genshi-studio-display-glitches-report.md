# Genshi Studio Display Glitches Analysis Report

**Agent**: DEVELOPER_004 (Frontend Developer)  
**Date**: 2025-07-09  
**URL Analyzed**: https://bob-takuya.github.io/genshi-studio/

## Executive Summary

The Genshi Studio site appears to be a self-contained single-page application with all CSS and JavaScript inline. While the code structure appears technically sound, there are several potential display issues that could manifest in production:

## Potential Display Glitches Identified

### 1. **Font Loading Issues**
- **Primary Font**: 'SF Pro Display' - This is an Apple system font that may not be available on non-Apple devices
- **Potential Glitch**: Text may appear in fallback fonts on Windows/Linux, causing layout shifts
- **Impact**: Visual inconsistency across platforms

### 2. **Canvas Rendering Performance**
- **Issue**: Complex pattern generation runs on the main thread
- **Potential Glitch**: UI freezing or janky animations on lower-end devices
- **Symptoms**: Slider controls may become unresponsive during pattern updates

### 3. **Mobile Viewport Issues**
- **Observation**: While responsive CSS is present, the canvas-based design may have issues on mobile devices
- **Potential Glitches**: 
  - Pattern may be cut off on small screens
  - Touch interactions might conflict with browser gestures
  - Pinch-to-zoom might interfere with pattern controls

### 4. **Dark Mode Compatibility**
- **Issue**: The page uses a dark theme but doesn't check for system dark mode preference
- **Potential Glitch**: May cause visual jarring when switching between this and other sites

### 5. **Resource Loading**
- **Observation**: All resources are inline, making the initial HTML very large (47KB)
- **Potential Glitch**: Slow initial page load on slower connections
- **No external resource dependencies found** - This is actually good for reliability

### 6. **Browser Compatibility**
- **Modern JavaScript Features**: Uses ES6+ features without transpilation
- **Potential Glitch**: May not work on older browsers
- **No polyfills detected** for older browser support

### 7. **Accessibility Issues**
- **No ARIA labels** on interactive controls
- **Potential Glitch**: Screen readers won't properly announce controls
- **Color contrast** may not meet WCAG standards

## Deployment Configuration Analysis

- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Configured correctly via `.github/workflows/static.yml`
- **Deployment Path**: Entire repository root is deployed
- **No Build Process**: Static files deployed as-is

## Recommendations

1. **Add Font Fallbacks**: Include web-safe fonts in the font stack
2. **Implement Web Workers**: Move pattern generation to background thread
3. **Add Loading States**: Show progress during pattern generation
4. **Test on Real Devices**: Especially older Android devices and iPads
5. **Add Error Boundaries**: Handle canvas rendering failures gracefully
6. **Implement Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality without JavaScript
7. **Add Performance Monitoring**: Track real user metrics

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **No Error Handling**: If canvas fails to initialize, the entire app breaks
2. **Memory Leaks**: Pattern generation may accumulate memory over time
3. **Touch Event Handling**: May have issues on iOS Safari

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test on various devices and browsers
2. Use Chrome DevTools device emulation
3. Check Network throttling scenarios
4. Validate with screen readers
5. Run Lighthouse audits
