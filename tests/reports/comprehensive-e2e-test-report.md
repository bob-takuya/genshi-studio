- Celtic Knots ‚úÖ
- Mandelbrot Fractal ‚úÖ
- Crystal Lattice ‚úÖ

### Keyboard Shortcuts Analysis
**Status**: Non-functional or not implemented

The specified keyboard shortcuts (Space, R, E, P, F, S) could not be verified due to:
1. Deployment accessibility issues preventing interaction testing
2. Possible missing JavaScript event handlers
3. No visible response to keyboard input

### User Interface Features Analysis
**Status**: Core features missing or non-functional

- **Presets**: No preset loading interface detected
- **Bookmarks**: No bookmark save/restore functionality found
- **Export**: Export buttons present but not triggering downloads
- **Auto-evolve**: Cannot verify functionality
- **Parameter Controls**: Basic sliders detected but interaction unclear

## Workflow Compliance Assessment

### AI Creative Team System Requirements
According to CLAUDE.md, this task **MUST** repeat the entire workflow cycle until complete implementation is confirmed through successful E2E test execution.

**Current Status**: ‚ùå **WORKFLOW REPETITION REQUIRED**

The team MUST:
1. Return to development phase
2. Fix all identified critical issues
3. Re-implement missing features  
4. Re-run complete E2E test suite
5. Achieve 90%+ pass rate before marking task complete

---

## Conclusion

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Genshi Studio **DOES NOT MEET** production deployment standards and fails to achieve the mandatory 90% E2E test pass rate required by ACTS.

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **DO NOT DEPLOY** current version to production
2. **RESTART DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW** to address critical issues
3. **FIX DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION** to enable proper testing
4. **IMPLEMENT MISSING FEATURES** specified in requirements

### Success Criteria for Next Iteration
- [ ] 90%+ E2E test pass rate across all browsers
- [ ] All 9 specified pattern types functional
- [ ] All keyboard shortcuts working
- [ ] Preset and bookmark systems implemented
- [ ] Export functionality working properly
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance standards met
- [ ] Accessibility compliance achieved

**Until these criteria are met, the application is NOT ready for production deployment.**
