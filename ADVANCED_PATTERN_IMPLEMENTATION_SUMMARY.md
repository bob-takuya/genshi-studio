## 📈 Feature Highlights

### 1. Custom Pattern Builder
```typescript
// Example usage
const generator = new AdvancedPatternGenerator();
const customPattern = generator.createCustomVariation(
  PatternType.Seigaiha,
  'My Custom Waves',
  'Personalized wave pattern',
  { scale: 1.5, waveHeight: 2, complexity: 8 }
);
```

### 2. Pattern Animation
```typescript
// Animate patterns with keyframes
generator.generateAnimatedPattern(
  PatternType.Asanoha,
  400, 400,
  baseOptions,
  {
    duration: 3,
    direction: 'alternate',
    keyframes: [
      { time: 0, parameters: { rotation: 0 } },
      { time: 1, parameters: { rotation: 360 } }
    ]
  }
);
```

### 3. Pattern Combination
```typescript
// Combine multiple patterns
const combination = {
  patterns: [
    { patternId: 'seigaiha', blendMode: 'multiply', opacity: 0.8 },
    { patternId: 'asanoha', blendMode: 'overlay', opacity: 0.6 }
  ],
  compositionMode: 'screen'
};
```

### 4. Storage and Sharing
```typescript
// Save and share patterns
PatternStorageService.savePattern(customPattern);
const shareUrl = PatternStorageService.generateShareableUrl(customPattern);
```
