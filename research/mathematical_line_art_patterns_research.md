## 1. Flow Fields and Vector Fields

### Mathematical Foundation
Flow fields are grids of vectors that define paths for particle movement. At each grid point, an angle is stored that determines the direction of flow.

### Key Implementation Details
- **Grid Structure**: 2D array of floating point numbers representing angles
- **Particle Movement**: Particles follow the angle at their current position
- **Perlin Noise Integration**: Using Perlin noise with a z parameter for time creates flowing animations

### Animation Parameters
- **Step Size**: Controls movement speed along flow lines
- **Number of Particles**: Density of animated elements
- **Line Length**: Determined by iteration count
- **Minimum Distance**: Prevents curve convergence for cleaner aesthetics
- **Curl Noise**: Alternative that prevents line convergence entirely

### Notable Artists
- **Tyler Hobbs**: Created Fidenza using flow diagrams
- **George M Savva**: Uses complex numbers in R for mathematical art

## 2. Lissajous Curves and Harmonographs

### Mathematical Formulas
**Basic Lissajous**:
```
x = A sin(at + φ)
y = B sin(bt)
```

**Harmonograph with Damping**:
```
x(t) = A cos(ωₓt - δₓ) * e^(-d*t)
y(t) = B cos(ωᵧt - δᵧ) * e^(-d*t)
```

### Key Parameters
- **Amplitude (A, B)**: Controls wave size on each axis
- **Frequency Ratio (a/b)**: Determines pattern shape (rational = closed, irrational = rotating)
- **Phase (φ, δ)**: Creates rotation and aspect ratio changes
- **Damping (d)**: Typically ~0.002 for realistic decay

### Visual Characteristics
- a=b creates ellipses (circles when A=B, δ=π/2)
- Ratio 5/4 produces 5 horizontal and 4 vertical lobes
- Visual forms suggest 3D knots

## 3. Reaction-Diffusion Patterns (Turing Patterns)

### Mathematical Foundation
Semi-linear parabolic PDEs:
```
∂_t q = D∇²q + R(q)
```
Where:
- q(x,t) = vector function
- D = diffusion coefficients matrix
- R = local reactions

### Pattern Generation
- **Gray-Scott Equations**: Complex patterns without Turing instabilities
- **Parameter k**: Controls spot-to-stripe transitions
- **Parameter s**: Larger values create smaller spots

### Gradient Effects
- **Production Rate Gradients**: Stripes orient perpendicular to gradient
- **Parameter Gradients**: Stripes orient parallel to gradient
- **Anisotropies**: In diffusion or growth affect pattern orientation

### Interactive Control
- Sound wave decomposition via FFT to control parameters
- Real-time parameter modification creates pattern "flow"

## 4. Strange Attractors

### Lorenz Attractor
**Equations**:
```
dx/dt = σ(-x + y)
dy/dt = -xz + ρx - y
dz/dt = xy - βz
```

**Classic Parameters**: σ = 10, ρ = 28, β = 8/3

### Rössler Attractor
**Equations**:
```
ẋ = -y - z
ẏ = x + ay
ż = b + z(x - c)
```

### Implementation for Line Art
- **Time Step**: dt = 0.01 for smooth curves
- **Scaling**: Different for each attractor (e.g., 7.0 for Lorenz)
- **Trajectory Tracing**: Store points and connect for continuous lines
- **Never Repeats**: Creates organic, infinitely varying patterns

## 5. Differential Growth Algorithms

### Core Algorithm
1. Start with connected nodes (circle or line)
2. Apply forces:
   - **Alignment Force**: Keep nodes in line with neighbors
   - **Repulsion Force**: Maintain distance between nodes
3. Introduce new nodes where curve bends sharply
4. Never allows self-intersection

### Key Parameters
- **Repulsion Radius**: Detection range for node avoidance
- **Split Length**: Edge length triggering new node insertion
- **Growth Speed**: Factor for force application
- **Node Distance**: Min/max thresholds for merging/splitting

### Visual Techniques
- Paint curve position at each time step
- Draw outside position for 3D illusion effect
- Use R-tree spatial indexing for performance

## 6. Wave Interference Patterns

### Mathematical Basis
**Superposition Principle**: Net displacement = sum of individual wave displacements

**Constructive Interference**: d sin θ = mλ

### Animation Techniques
- **Circular Paths**: Draw waves on circles for organic blob forms
- **Phase Manipulation**: Continuous phase changes create animation
- **Beat Patterns**: Frequency variations create rhythmic effects

### Implementation Tips
- Start with two different sine waves
- Adjust parameters iteratively for pleasing patterns
- Where crests meet: amplitude doubles
- Where crest meets trough: cancellation occurs

## 7. Perlin Noise Flow Fields

### Mathematical Components
```
N(x) = Σ[i=⌊x⌋ to ⌊x⌋+1] G_i · (x - i) · F(x - i)
```
Where:
- G_i = gradient vector at grid point
- F(x) = fade function with zero derivatives at grid nodes

### Key Features
- **Coherent Noise**: Smooth, continuous values
- **Multi-Scale Detail**: Multiple octaves for complexity
- **3D Animation**: Move through z-slices for time evolution

### Control Parameters
- **Scale/Frequency**: 0.004 creates interesting patterns
- **Octaves**: Number of noise layers
- **Amplitude**: Strength of each octave
- **Z-increment**: Animation speed through 3D noise

### Organic Characteristics
- Neighboring values are related
- Particles follow "currents" that emerge naturally
- Field changes over time, breaking and forming new paths

## Implementation Recommendations

### For Beautiful Thin Line Animations:
1. **Combine Techniques**: Layer multiple pattern types for complexity
2. **Parameter Interpolation**: Smooth transitions between parameter values
3. **Color Gradients**: Map parameters to gradient positions
4. **Opacity Variation**: Fade lines based on age or velocity
5. **Multi-Threading**: Use spatial indexing for performance with many particles

### Organic Control Methods:
- Audio-reactive parameters (FFT analysis)
- Mouse/touch interaction for real-time manipulation
- Environmental data (time, weather, sensor input)
- Machine learning for pattern evolution
- Feedback loops for self-modifying systems
